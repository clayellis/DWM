    - Initialized with a `TaskFrequency`
    - Contains a `TaskManager`
    - Manages the list reminder
    - The order of tasks (v2, don't spend any time on this for now)

- Determine a good error handling strategy

- Test throwing errors

- Make wording consistent
    - delete vs remove
    - insert vs store
    - "all", "records", "noun(s)" vs retrieve

- Start work on basic UI
    - List carousel view
    - Lists
